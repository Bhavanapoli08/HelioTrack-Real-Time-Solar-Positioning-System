## üìù Overview

**HelioTrack** is a real-time clock (RTC)-based solar tracking system designed to improve the efficiency of solar panels by dynamically adjusting their orientation with respect to the sun's position throughout the day.

This embedded system project utilizes the **AT89C51 microcontroller**, **servo motors**, and **LDR sensors** to monitor light intensity and reposition the panel accordingly. The implementation led to a **32% increase in power generation** compared to static solar panels.

void delay(unsigned int);
void servo_delay(unsigned int);

void main() {
    servo_pin = 0;
    P1 = 0;
    while(1) {
        if (LDR1 == 1) {
            servo_pin = 1;
            servo_delay(50);
            servo_pin = 0;
            delay(1000);
        }
        if (LDR2 == 1) {
            servo_pin = 1;
            servo_delay(123);
            servo_pin = 0;
            delay(1000);
        }
